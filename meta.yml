synopsis: Framework for verification of implementations of distributed systems in Coq

description: |-
  Verdi is a Coq framework to implement and formally verify distributed systems.
  Verdi supports several different fault models ranging from idealistic to realistic.
  Verdi's verified system transformers (VSTs) encapsulate common fault tolerance
  techniques. Developers can verify an application in an idealized fault model, and
  then apply a VST to obtain an application that is guaranteed to have analogous
  properties in a more adversarial environment.

  ## Building and installation instructions

  We recommend installing Verdi via [opam](http://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html),
  which will automatically build and install its dependencies:
  ```shell
  opam repo add coq-extra-dev https://coq.inria.fr/opam/extra-dev
  opam install coq-verdi
  ```

  To build Verdi manually, first install all requirements. Then,
  run `make` in the Verdi root directory.  This will compile
  the framework's core specifications and proofs, as well as some
  simple example systems and their correctness proofs.

  To run Verdi systems on real hardware, event handler code must be extracted
  to OCaml and linked with one of the shims in the Verdi
  [runtime library](https://github.com/DistributedComponents/verdi-runtime)
  that handles low-level network communication.

  ## Documentation
 
  To set up your own Verdi-based distributed systems verification project, we
  recommend basing it on
  [Verdi LockServ](https://github.com/DistributedComponents/verdi-lockserv).

  Verdi LockServ contains a minimalistic implementation of a message-passing
  lock server and a proof that it maintains mutual exclusion between client
  nodes. At build time, extracted OCaml code is linked to a runtime library
  shim to produce an executable program that can be run in a cluster. There
  is also a simple script to interface with cluster nodes.

  In addition to the example verified systems listed below, see the
  scientific papers and blog posts listed at the
  [Verdi website](http://verdi.uwplse.org). See also
  [Verdi Raft](https://github.com/uwplse/verdi-raft), a verified
  implementation of the Raft distributed consensus protocol.

  ### Files

  - Core Verdi files:
    - `Verdi.v`: exporting of core Verdi theories, imported by systems
    - `Net.v`: core (unlabeled) network semantics
    - `LabeledNet.v`: labeled network semantics, for use in liveness reasoning
    - `HandlerMonad.v`: a monad for writing network/input handlers
    - `StatePacketPacket.v`: a technique for writing easily decomposable
    invariants
  - Example systems:
    - `Counter.v`: counting server with backup
    - `LockServ.v`: lock server with proof of safety
    - `LiveLockServ.v`: lock server with proof of liveness
    - `VarD.v`: `vard`, a key-value store
  - Verified system transformers:
    - `SeqNum.v` and `SeqNumCorrect.v`, a system transformer implementing sequence numbering
    - `LockServSeqNum.v`, the sequence numbering transformer applied to the lock server
    - `PrimaryBackup.v`, a system transformer implementing asynchronous primary-backup replication
    - `VarDPrimaryBackup.v`, the primary-backup transformer applied to the key-value store
